# Interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard using Excel Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive Excel project focused on creating an engaging and interactive coffee sales dashboard. Leveraging the power of pivot tables and pivot charts, this project showcases a dynamic dashboard that offers insightful visualizations for coffee sales analysis.

### Defining the Problem
What are the factors and customer preferences determining coffee sales orders and to what degree?

### Source of Data
The coffee sales data is sourced from a github. Link:[CoffeeSalesData](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx)

### Preparing the Data
The data was cleaned and transformed in excel using data analysis excel functions such as TRIM, VLOOKUP etc.

### Features of the Dashboard - Data Analysis, Visualization and Communication

1. **Date Slicer:** The dashboard features an intuitive date slicer, allowing users to dynamically filter data based on specific time periods. This enhances the user's ability to analyze sales trends and patterns over time.

2. **Total Sales over Time Line Plot:** The dashboard includes a visually appealing line plot that illustrates the total sales evolution over different time intervals. Users can easily identify growth trends and seasonal variations.

3. **Coffee Sales by Country:** A pivot chart is utilized to showcase coffee sales distribution across various countries. This visualization provides a clear understanding of which countries contribute most significantly to overall sales.

4. **Top Five Customers:** The dashboard offers insights into the top five customers in terms of sales volume. This pivot chart helps in identifying key clients and understanding their contribution to the business.

5. **Roast Type Name Filter:** This feature allows to filter sales at roast type levels of Dark, Light and Medium to understang customer preferences.

6. **Loyalty Card Filter:** We can filter to know how sales volume varies across customers with a loyalty card and those without a loyalty card.

7. **Size Filter:** Coffee is sold in different sizes. We understand how sales is aggregated at size levels using this filter.
